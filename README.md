Purpose
- This repository contains a single-page, static portfolio / educational webpage I built for the IAII assignment/project. Its purpose is to present my work and to demonstrate fundamental web development skills (HTML, basic styling and structure) in a lightweight, easy-to-deploy format.

Project snapshot
- Type: Static portfolio / educational webpage (single-page)
- Primary language: HTML
- Main file: `index.html` (contains the site content and markup)
- Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (see Live demo link above)
- Default branch: `main`
- Last pushed: 2025-11-11T15:54:55Z


What this repository contains
- index.html — The complete front-end for the portfolio page. This is the single source of truth for the site content and structure.
  - URL: https://github.com/deepthi-aiml/My-Web-Project-IAII/blob/main/index.html
- README.md — This file (project overview and usage)

Why this structure
- Single-file HTML keeps the project minimal and portable for an educational portfolio: easy to inspect, edit, and deploy without a build step.
- Hosting on Vercel provides a simple continuous deployment route from the repository — ideal for static portfolios.

How to view locally
- Simplest: open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Alternative (serving over HTTP is occasionally required for some browser features):
  - From the repository root run a simple static server, e.g.:
    - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` and open http://localhost:8000
  - Or use any static file server you prefer and point it at the repository root.

What the site represents (brief analysis from my perspective)
- Scope: A focused, educational portfolio site intended to showcase projects, contact details and basic explanatory content — not a full web application.
- Strengths:
  - Minimal and portable — easy for reviewers to open and read the source.
  - Fast to load — no build pipeline or heavy dependencies.
  - Deployed and shareable via a public URL.
- Constraints:
  - Static only — no server-side features or dynamic content.
  - All core content is in `index.html`, so structure and maintainability are tied to that file.
